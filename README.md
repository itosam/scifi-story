Chapter 1- Alien Take Over

Above the skies there are flying objects coming down.
The objects, as they get closer, they look like giant pinballs.
They land on the ground like soft pillows, with no sound.
A door opens and out come a large grey "thing".
They descend on the land, looking for "something".
